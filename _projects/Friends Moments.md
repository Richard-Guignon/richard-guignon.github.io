A playlist of demonstration video is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEgzyCSpwH0PLfUOf27vJTp20BxPA3idh), including a [full session video (in french)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOn94lxBbRE&list=PLEgzyCSpwH0PLfUOf27vJTp20BxPA3idh&index=8)

The interaction and locomotion stack is homemade, and is part of a set of UPM packages that we created to allow to easily quickstart networked virtual reality applications.
