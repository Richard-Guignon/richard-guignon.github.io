**Inclure montage esquisses-version finale + travaux de design et conception.**


Initiated in 2013, the main idea of ​​this project was to develop a generic electronic module allowing partners to create connected products and services very quickly without supporting the hardware design and production costs.
Pops firmware is customized for each partner to cover different types of use cases as described in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOjeBXWswa0)

The version of Pops has been unveiled during the Show Hello event 2014, with several partners (Quiksilver, Yummypets, etc.).
It was a real challenge to put all components in a so small device (GSM, GPS, bluetooth, CPU, battery, accelerometer, button, antenna, etc...), but we did it !

Multiple accessories have been designed and prototyped to support the different use cases.

In order to improve overall performance, a second version with a larger screen has been developped (Hello Show 2016).

We received several [awards](/resume/#awards) and the Pops has been in demonstration during the Mobile World Congress 2017.


During 2017, thanks do the Pops (rebranded Live Module), the police [dismantled a network](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/gr%C3%A2ce-au-live-module-dorange-la-police-d%C3%A9mant%C3%A8le-un-r%C3%A9seau-bretones/) that stole nearly 1,200 bicycles a year.

Also, a SDK has been developed to allow customers to adapt the Pops firmware to their needs by themself.
