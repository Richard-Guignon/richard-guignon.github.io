Initiated in 2013, the main idea of ​​this project was to develop a generic electronic module allowing partners to create connected products and services very quickly without supporting the hardware design and production costs.
**POPS** firmware is customized for each partner to cover different types of use cases as described in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOjeBXWswa0)

The first version of **POPS** has been unveiled during the **Show Hello** event 2014, with several partners (**Quiksilver**, **Yummypets**, etc.).
It was a real challenge to put all components in a so small device (GSM, GPS, bluetooth, CPU, battery, accelerometer, button, antenna, etc...), but we did it !

Multiple accessories have been designed and prototyped to support the different use cases.

In order to improve overall performance, a second version with a larger screen has been developped (**Hello Show** 2016).

We received several [awards](/resume/#awards) and the Pops has been in demonstration during the **Mobile World Congress** 2017.


During 2017, thanks to the **POPS** (rebranded **Live Module**), the police [dismantled a network](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/gr%C3%A2ce-au-live-module-dorange-la-police-d%C3%A9mant%C3%A8le-un-r%C3%A9seau-bretones/) that stole nearly 1,200 bicycles a year.

Also, a SDK has been developed to allow customers to adapt the **POPS** firmware to their needs by themself.

I initiated this project and contributed in all stages : from the first design process until the industrial production stage, specially :
- service and user experience design,
- product design and prototyping thanks to 3D printing,
- software & hardware development management,
- resources and budgetary trade-off,
- product specification & development with partners,
- public demonstration during showcases like "Orange Hello Show" or "Osons la France"
