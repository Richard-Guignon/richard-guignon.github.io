With this application, people can collaborate together as if they were in the same room.
They can use post-it, agile board, pens, 3D air pens, whiteboard, dictaphone (with Google Speech recognition), ... and import and work on various documents (pdf, fbx, images, ...) added through a dedicated web portal.
They can also miniaturizes themself on special places to see created or imported object in real size scale.

A very important focus has been put on ensuring a very simple and straightforward experience, accessible to every users. 
It has been done thanks to rapid prototyping and fast iteration through feedback and user testing.

The application has been presented in several events ([Orange Hello Show](https://pic.twitter.com/SBNjz6M18j), [Biennale internationale du Design de Saint-Etienne](https://pic.twitter.com/iBwoxjAU3m), [InOut](https://pic.twitter.com/FYWQbzqkWR), [Orange Business summit](https://pic.twitter.com/W3ddj2sFOr), ...) and has been tested by more than a thousand users, bringing a lot of feedback and improvement opportunities.

This project started as a bottom-up anticipation project. 
My project contributions was very large :
- convince stakeholders to invest into the subject thanks to a quick prototype,
- advocate budget & use case to a vast set of internal stakeholders, 
- provide project reporting,
- public demonstration during showcases,
- work collaboratively with designers, engineers, and ergonomists,
- customer facing workshops,
- initiate and follow up experiments with several customers,
- interpret customer feedback to inform user-focused designs,
- product design decisions,

On technical aspect : 
- develop UX prototypes and mockups to drive and inform product direction,
- design final UX,
- spatial design, 
- assets selection & customization (models, textures, materials, lights),
- render pipeline, 
- avatar integration, 
- C# components creation,
