They can use post-it, pens, air pens, whitepapers, dictaphone (with Google Speech recognition), ... and import and work on various documents (pdf, fbx, images, ...) added through a dedicated web portal.
They can also miniaturizes themself on special places to see created or imported object in real size scale.
