I am Richard. After beginning my career in IT system administration and VoIP service engineering, I evolved as a UX Designer & Prototyper in a multidisciplinary team of designers, ergonomicists, sociologists and developpers.

For the past few years, I have concentrated my efforts in Virtual Reality field. 
So I am in charge of researching, designing and prototyping interaction and new services.
